</p> Hello, my name is Dylan Gilmore. I'm 18 years old and a senior in high school at The Palmdale Aerospace Academy. I love sports, academics, family, friends, and movies. I've played baseball, basketball, volleyball, and in my spare time, I go bowling. Also in my spare time, I love to read books, watch television, and play video games. I would want to travel the world. I'm very shy and quiet when it comes to talking with friends, I'm very different. I want to be a math teacher when I grow up.  

I grew up in Palmdale, California and I've lived there all of my life. I was born in Lancaster and moved to Palmdale when I was little. I grew up without a father and I still despise him to this day. I grew up with only my mother and my brother. Recenty, I had a stepfather who I despise and my brother moved out. Oh well, I guess. I'm very moody and sarcastic. I stay emotional detached from my friends. That is just the Sagittarius way of saying, "I don't love you."
