</p> Hello, my name is Dylan Gilmore. I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school at The Palmdale Aerospace Academy. I love sports, academics, family, friends, and movies. I've played baseball, basketball, volleyball, and in my spare time, I go bowling. Also in my spare time, I love to read books, watch television, and play video games. I would want to travel the world. I'm very shy and quiet when it comes to talking with friends, I'm very different. I want to be a math teacher when I grow up.  

I grew up in Palmdale, California and I've lived there all of my life. I was born in Lancaster and moved to Palmdale when I was little. I grew up without a father and I still despise him to this day. I grew up with only my mother and my brother. Recenty, I had a stepfather who I despise and my brother moved out. I've been living in the closet for a couple of years now. No one knows that I'm bisexual. Oops, did I just put that in my about page? Oh well, I guess. They were going to find out eventually. Plus, if you are a person who is undecided about their sexuality, you can't make a decision until you taste the rainbow.
